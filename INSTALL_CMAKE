Psi4 can now be configured with CMAKE.  Builds must be performed in a separate
build directory, and can be customized through command line arguments or by
passing definitions to cmake.  As an example, we'll consider building the code
from $PSI4/obj.  The basic cmake invocation would be

    cmake ..

To set the installation directory and C++ compiler to use, we can do either

    cmake .. -D PREFIX=/path/to/psi -D CXX=g++

or
    # on BASH-like shells
    export PREFIX="/path/to/psi" 
    export CXX=g++
    # on CSH-like shells
    setenv PREFIX "/path/to/psi"
    setenv CXX=g++

    cmake ..

These can be mixed in any order, with -D commands taking precedence.  Psi4
currently recognizes the following options:-

CXX_FLAGS        Extra C++ compiler flags to be used in compilation (string)
                 default:""

LD_FLAGS         Extra flags to be used in linking (string)
                 default:""

LIBINT_MAX_AM    The maximum angular momentum to allow for integrals (1=p,2=d,3=f, etc.).  First and second
                 derivatives are supported up to LIBINT_MAX_AM-1 and LIBINT_MAX_AM-2, respectively. (int)
                 default:5

PREFIX           The installation directory for psi4 (string)
                 default:/usr/local/psi4

USE_SYSTEM_BOOST Whether to use system boost, if detected. False forces Psi to build its own Boost. (boolean)
                 default:true
