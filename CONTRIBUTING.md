# How to contribute

We welcome contributions from external contributors, and this document
describes how to merge code changes into Psi4.  As of February 2016, the
procedure for contributing code is exactly the same for the core development
team and for external contributors.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the psi4/psi4 repository on GitHub.
* Optionally, sign up for an account on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

## Making Changes

* On your local machine, clone your fork of the psi4 repo, which is located at
  github.com:yourusername/psi4
* Add some really awesome code.  It's usually a good idea to make changes on
  a new branch, but that is not mandatory.
* If it's a new feature, you must add test cases and documentation.
* When the code is ready to go, make sure you run the full test suite to make
  sure nothing was broken.
* If all tests pass, you can push the code to your fork of Psi4 on GitHub.  If
  you signed up for a Travis CI account and linked it to your GitHub profile,
  some rudimentary tests will automatically start.
* Sign in to GitHub, navigate to your fork of Psi4 and submit a pull request.
* If the tests all pass, on of the Psi4 admin team will merge the code into the
  main repository for you.
