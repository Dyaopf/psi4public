Psi4 is an open-source suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs
designed for efficient, high-accuracy simulations of a variety of
molecular properties. We can routinely perform computations with more
than 2500 basis functions running serially or on multi-core machines.

With computationally demanding portions written in C++, Boost exports
of many C++ classes into Python, and a flexible Python driver, Psi4
strives to be friendly to both users and developers.
