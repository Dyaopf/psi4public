Psi4 is an open-source suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs designed for efficient,
high-accuracy simulations of a variety of molecular properties. We can routinely perform
computations with more than 2500 basis functions running serially or with modest parallelism.

With computationally demanding portions written in C++, Boost exports of many C++ classes into
Python, and a flexible Python driver, PSI4 strives to be friendly to both users and developers.
