Psi4 is an open-source suite of ab initio quantum chemistry programs designed for efficient,
high-accuracy simulations of a variety of molecular properties. We can routinely perform
computations with more than 2500 basis functions running serially or with modest parallelism.

With computationally demanding portions written in C++, Boost exports of many C++ classes into
Python, and a flexible Python driver, PSI4 strives to be friendly to both users and developers.

..comment [22 Jan 2014] Renamed psi4release to psi4public, since master branch is continuously synced
..comment with private master branch, rather than reflecting static stable releases. Interested developers
..comment are welcome to fork this repository -OR- clone and store branches here at psi4/psi4public (those
..comment with collaborator access) -OR- clone and store private branches at psi4/psi4 (those with collaborator
..comment access to the private repo). A new stable, fully tested beta6 should appear within a few weeks.
..comment Youtube links to psi4 developer training should appear after our workshop this Friday.

..comment [11 Nov 2013] We are transitioning from main development on a private GitHub repository toward
..comment main development on this public repository. Sensitive code (prone to scientific scooping) will
..comment remain on the private branch, but otherwise we anticipate that contributions from both the primary
..comment developers and any interested persons shall be made here. As of today, the public and private 
..comment repos are synced, but this isn't necessarily the most stable version. A new stable, fully
..comment tested beta6 should appear before the end of the year.
