rasci-ne:     Ne atom RASCI/cc-pVQZ  Example of split-virtual CISD[TQ] from Sherrill and Schaefer, J. Phys. Chem. XXX This uses a "primary" virtual space 3s3p (RAS 2), a "secondary" virtual space 3d4s4p4d4f (RAS 3), and a "tertiary" virtual space consisting of the remaining virtuals.  First, an initial CISD computation is run to get the natural orbitals; this allows a meaningful partitioning of the virtual orbitals into groups of different importance.  Next, the RASCI is run.  The split-virtual CISD[TQ] takes all singles and doubles, and all triples and quadruples with no more than 2 electrons in the secondary virtual subspace (RAS 3).  If any electrons are present in the tertiary virtual subspace (RAS 4), then that excitation is only allowed if it is a single or double.
