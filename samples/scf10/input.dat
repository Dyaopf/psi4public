#! DF-SCF cc-pVDZ of benzene-hydronium ion, scanning the dissociation coordinate with
#! Python's built-in loop mechanism. The geometry is specified by a Z-matrix with dummy
#! atoms, fixed parameters, updated parameters, and separate charge/multiplicity
#! specifiers for each monomer. One-electron properties computed for dimer and one monomer.
