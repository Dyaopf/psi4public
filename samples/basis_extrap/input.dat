#! Various basis set extrapolation tests

# bse, basis_set_extrapolation, and basis_set_extrapolate are all different names for the same function

Li

set globals {

# The extrapolated value is returned, but you don't have to store it if you don't want to.
# If no WFN global variable is specified, the function does a hartree fock extrapolation

# Here's another example

molecule {
H
H 1 R

R = 1
}

set globals {

# Here we store the returned value in a variable for testing purposes only.  Again, you don't have to do this.
# The method will print a nice formatted results table all by itself
