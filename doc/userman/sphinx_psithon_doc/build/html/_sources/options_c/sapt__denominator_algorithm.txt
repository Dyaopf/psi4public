   DENOMINATOR_ALGORITHM
      Should the energy denominators be approximated with Laplace
      transformations or a Cholesky decomposition? We have found
      Laplace transformations to be slightly more efficient.
    
      * **Type**: string
      * **Possible Values**: LAPLACE, CHOLESKY
      * **Default**: LAPLACE
