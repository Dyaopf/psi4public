   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

..  * NOTES (LAB 2-15-2012)
    * Blank lines in this file usually matter.
    * For each new python file, add a new automodule section like below
      to place an entry and slurp docstrings from all module members.
          .. automodule:: newpythonfile
              :members:
              :undoc-members:
    * If there are aliases to functions, like opt and optimize, add all but
      one name to :exclude-members: to avoid duplicating the documentation.
    * Function signatures are got by introspection. To show a more detailed
      signature with options, give it a separate autofunction line, like below,
      and add it to the :exclude-members: list. Place optional arguments in
      square brackets.
          .. autofunction:: wrappers.cp(name[, func, check_bsse])
..  * NOTES (LAB 2-21-2012)
    * Functions to be regularly accessed in the input file (usually those
      that kwargs passes through) should get their own section (like
      Energy below). In the early stages of documentation, just place 
      the autofunction command in the section. When ready to add documentation
      outside the docstring, create a new rst file, along the lines of database.
    * When using LaTeX math in rst files, the \ character that is so abundant
      in LaTeX commands can be used normally. When using math in docstrings,
      though, any \ followed by character combination that has a shell
      meaning (e.g., \t for tab, \b for bell, \n for newline) must be
      escaped (e.g., \\text or \\beta).

.. These are abbreviations for arrows indicating default values
.. |dl| replace:: :math:`\Rightarrow`
.. |dr| replace:: :math:`\Leftarrow`

=======
General
=======

To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, PSI4 is built
upon the Python interpreter, with modifications termed Psithon. Chapter 3
of the User's Manual describes the non-standard Python associated with
clean molecule, basis, and option specification in the PSI4 input file.
This documentation addresses the pure Python side- what functions allow
the efficient compiled code to be run, what functions post-process and
interact with that output, and how the ordinary (or ambitious) user can
extent PSI4's functionality.

..  * NOTES (LAB 2-28-2012)
    * How to get PsiMod.py documentation into Sphinx
    * (1) In psi4/src/bin/psi4/python.cc , uncomment the following lines
          s = strdup("help(PsiMod)");
          PyRun_SimpleString(s);
    * (2) cd into objdir and make psi4
    * (3) cd into a testcase directory (e.g., cd tests/tu1-h2o-energy/)
          make clean
          make > $PSIDATADIR/../doc/userman/sphinx_psithon_doc/source/man_PsiMod.rst 
    * (4) Edit man_PsiMod.rst so that the first line (left justified) has
          a double colon and indent all the remainder of the file, matching below.
          Delete some junk at end of file.

          |    NAME
          |        PsiMod
    * (5) Rebuild Sphinx docs.
    * (6) LaTeX build can't handle including man_PsiMod.rst so comment out by default.
