\section{Theoretical Methods Available in \PSIfour}

Several electronic structure methods are available in the \PSIfour\
package, from Hartree--Fock molecular orbital theory to coupled-cluster
theory to full configuration interaction.  This section introduces
the methods available and some of their most common input parameters.
A complete list of standard options is provided in Appendix
\ref{keywords}, and keywords for expert users are listed in Appendix
\ref{expertkeywords}.
