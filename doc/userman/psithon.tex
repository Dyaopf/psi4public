\section{Psithon} \label{psithon}
 
To allow arbitrarily complex computations to be performed, \PSIfour was built
upon the Python interpreter. However, to make the input syntax simpler, some
pre-processing of the input file is performed before it is interpreted,
resulting in Python syntax that is customized for \PSI, termed Psithon.  In
this section we will describe the essential features of the Psithon language.
\PSIfour is distributed with an extensive test suite, described in section
\ref{test_suite}; the input files for these test cases can be found in the
samples subdirectory of the top-level \PSIfour source directory, and should
serve as useful examples.

\subsection{Molecule Specification}
\PSIfour has a very flexible input parser that allows the user to provide
geometries as Cartesian coordinates, Z-matrix variables, or a combination of
both. The use of fixed values and variables are supported for both. For
example, the geometry for H$_2$ can be specified a number of ways, using the
{\tt molecule} keyword:
\begin{Snippet}
molecule{
  H
  H 1 0.9
}

 or

molecule{
  H
  H 1 r
  r = 0.9
}

 or

molecule{
  H1
  H2 H1 0.9
}

 or

molecule{
  H 0.0 0.0 0.0
  H 0.0 0.0 0.9
}

 or

molecule{
  H 0.0 0.0 0.0
  H 0.0 0.0 r
  r = 0.9
}

 or

molecule{
  H 0.0 0.0 -r
  H 0.0 0.0 r
  r = 0.45
}
\end{Snippet}
Blank lines are ignored and, unlike regular Python syntax, indentation within
the {\tt molecule} block does not matter, although the {\tt molecule} keyword itself must
be aligned within the input according to standard Python syntax. For more
examples of geometry specification, see the mints1 input file in the samples
folder. It is also possible to mix Cartesian and Z-matrix geometry
specifications, as demonstrated in the {\tt mints4} sample input file.

\subsection{Multiple Molecules}

To facilitate more elaborate computations, it is possible to provide a name for
each molecule, and tell \PSIfour which one should be used in a given
calculation. For example, consider the following input file:
\begin{Snippet}
molecule h2{
  H
  H 1 0.9
}


set basis cc-pvdz
set reference rhf
energy('scf')

molecule h{
  H
}

set basis cc-pvdz
set reference uhf
energy('scf')
\end{Snippet}
Here, two separate jobs are performed on two different molecules; the first is
performed on H$_2$, while the second is for H atom. The last molecule to be
specified is the ``active'' molecule by default. To explicitly activate a named
molecule, the activate keyword is provided. Using this keyword, the above input
file can be equivalently written as follows:
\begin{Snippet}
molecule h2{
  H
  H 1 0.9
}

molecule h{
  H
}

activate(h2)
set basis cc-pvdz
set reference rhf
energy('scf')

activate{h}
set basis cc-pvdz
set reference uhf
energy('scf')
\end{Snippet}
Note that whenever the molecule is changed, the basis set must be specified
again. The following section provides more details about the job control
keywords used in the above examples.

\subsection{Additional Keywords}

In addition to specifying the geometry, additional information can be provided
in the {\tt molecule} block. If two integers are encountered on any line of the
{\tt molecule} block, they are interpreted as the molecular charge and multiplicity
($2\times M_s + 1$), respectively; these values can also be specified using the
{\tt set} keywords in the input, as described in the next section. The symmetry can
be specified by a line reading ``symmetry {\it symbol}'', where {\it symbol} is
the Sch\"onflies symbol of the (Abelian) point group to use for the
computation. This need not be specified, as the molecular symmetry is
automatically detected by \PSIfour.  Certain computations require that the
molecule is not reoriented; this can be achieved by adding either
``no\_reorient'' or ``noreorient''. By default, \AA ngstr\"om units are used;
this is changed by adding a line that reads ``units {\it spec}'', where {\it
spec} is one of ``ang'', ``angstrom'', ``bohr'', ``au'', or ``a.u.''. As an
example, the following specifies

\subsection{Non-Covalently Bonded Molecule Fragments}

\PSIfour has an extensive range of tools for treating non-covalent
intermolecular forces, including counterpoise corrections and symmetry adapted
perturbation theory methods. These require the definition of which fragments
are interacting within the complex. \PSIfour provides a very simple mechanism
for doing so; simply define the complexâ€™s geometry using the standard
Cartesian, Z-matrix, or mixture thereof, specifications and then place two
dashes between nonbonded fragements. For example, to study the interaction
energy of ethane and ethyne molecules, we could use the following molecule
block:
\begin{Snippet}
molecule{
  0 1
  C  0.000000 -0.667578  -2.124659
  C  0.000000  0.667578  -2.124659
  H  0.923621 -1.232253  -2.126185
  H -0.923621 -1.232253  -2.126185
  H -0.923621  1.232253  -2.126185
  H  0.923621  1.232253  -2.126185
  --
  0 1
  C 0.000000 0.000000 2.900503
  C 0.000000 0.000000 1.693240 
  H 0.000000 0.000000 0.627352
  H 0.000000 0.000000 3.963929
}
\end{Snippet}
In this case, the charge and multiplicity of each interacting fragment is
explicitly specified. If the charge and multiplicity are specified for the
first fragement, it is assumed to be the same for all fragments. When
considering interacting fragments, the overall charge is simply the sum of all
fragement charges, and any unpaired electrons are assumed to be coupled to
yield the highest possible $M_s$ value.

\subsection{Job Control}
\PSIfour comprises a number of modules, written in C++, that each perform
specific tasks and are callable directly from the Python front end. Each module
recognizes specific keywords in the input file, detailed in chapter B, which
control its function. The keywords can be made global, or scoped to apply to
certain specific modules. The following examples demonstrate some of the ways
that global variables can be specified:
\begin{Snippet}
set globals basis cc-pVDZ

 or

set basis cc-pVDZ

 or

set globals basis = cc-pVDZ

 or

set basis = cc-pVDZ

 or

set globals{
  basis cc-pVDZ
}

 or

set{
  basis cc-pVDZ
}

 or

set{
  basis = cc-pVDZ
}
\end{Snippet}
Note the lack of quotes around ``cc-pVDZ'', even though it is a string. The
Psithon preprocessor automatically wraps any string values in {\tt set} commands in
strings. The last three examples provide a more convenient way for specifying
multiple keywords:
\begin{Snippet}
set{
  basis = cc-pVDZ
  print = 1
  reference = rhf
}
\end{Snippet}
For arguments that require an array input, standard Python list syntax should
be used, viz:
\begin{Snippet}
set{
  docc = [3, 0, 1, 1]
}
\end{Snippet}
Any of the above keywords specifications can be scoped to individual modules,
by adding the name of the module after the {\tt set} keyword. Ommiting the module
name, or using the name ``global'' or ``globals'' will result in the keyword being
applied to all modules. For example, in the following input
\begin{Snippet}
molecule{
  o
  h 1 roh
  h 1 roh 2 ahoh

  roh = 0.957
  ahoh = 104.5
}

set basis cc-pVDZ
set ccenergy print 3
set scf print 1
energy('ccsd')
\end{Snippet}
the basis set is set to cc-pVDZ throughout, the SCF code will have a print
level of 1 and the ccenergy code, which performs coupled cluster computations,
will use a print level of 3. In this example a full CCSD computation is
performed by running the SCF code first, and then the coupled cluster modules;
the energy Python helper function ensures that this is performed correctly.
Note that the Python interpreter executes commands in the order they appear in
the input file, so if the last four commands in the above example were to read
\begin{Snippet}
set basis cc-pVDZ
energy('ccsd')
set ccenergy print 3
set scf print 1
\end{Snippet}
the commands that set the print level would be inneffective, as they would be
processed after the CCSD computation completes. In addition to specifying
charge and multiplicity in the {\tt molecule} block, they can be set through {\tt set}
commands:
\begin{Snippet}
set charge 1 # A cation
set multp 3  # A triplet electronic state
\end{Snippet}

\subsection{Memory Specification}
By default, \PSIfour assumes that 256 Mb of memory are available. While this is
enough for many computations, many of the algorithms will perform better if
more is available. To specify memory, the memory should be used. The following
lines are all equivalent methods for specifying that 2 Gb of RAM is available
to \PSIfour:
\begin{Snippet}
memory 2 Gb

 or

memory 2000 Mb

 or

memory 2000000 Kb
\end{Snippet}

\subsection{Return Values and \PSI Variables}

To harness the power of Python, \PSIfour makes the most pertinent results of
each computation are made available to the Python interpreter for
post-processing. Do demonstrate, we can embellish the previous example of H$_2$
and H atom:
\begin{Snippet}
molecule h2{
  H
  H 1 0.9
}

set basis cc-pvdz
set reference rhf
h2_energy = energy('scf')

molecule h{
  H
}

set basis cc-pvdz
set reference uhf
h_energy = energy('scf')

D_e = 627.51*(2*h_energy - h2_energy)
print"De=%f"%D_e
\end{Snippet}
The {\tt energy} function returns the final result of the computation, which we
assign to a Python variable. The two energies are then converted to a
dissociation energy, and printed to the output file, using standard Python
notation. Sometimes there are multiple quantities of interest; these can be
accessed through the {\tt get\_variable} function. For example, after performing a
density fitted MP2 computation, both the spin component scaled energy and the
unscaled MP2 energy are made available:
\begin{Snippet}
e_mp2=get_variable('DF-MP2ENERGY')
e_scs_mp2=get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2ENERGY')
\end{Snippet}
Refer to the documentation for each module for a listing of the variables set.

\subsection{Loops}
Python provides many control structures, which can be used within \PSIfour
input files. For example, to loop over three basis sets, the following code can
be used:
\begin{Snippet}
basis_sets=["cc-pVDZ","cc-pVTZ","cc-pVQZ"]
for basis_set in basis_sets:
    set basis = $basis_set
    energy('scf')
\end{Snippet}
The declaration of basis\_sets is completely standard Python, as is the next
line, which iterates over the list. However, because the Psithon preprocessor
wraps strings in quotes by default, we have to tell it that basis\_sets is a
Python variable, not a string, by prefixing it with a dollar sign. The geometry
specification supports delayed initialization of variable, which permits
potential energy scans. As an example, we can scan both the angle and bond
length in water:
\begin{Snippet}
molecule h2o{
  O
  H1 R
  H1 R2 A
}

Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]
Avals=range(102,106,2)

set basis cc-pvdz
set scf e_converge=11
forR in Rvals:
    h2o.R = R
    for A in Avals:
        h2o.A = A
        scf()
\end{Snippet}
The declarations of Rvals and Avals are both completely standard Python syntax.
Having named our molecule ``h2o'' we can then set the values of R and A within
the loops. Note that we do not need the dollar sign to access the Python
variable in this example; that is required only when using Python variables
with the {\tt set} keyword.

\subsection{Tables of Results}
The results of computations can be compactly tabulated with the Table Psithon
function. For example, in the following potential energy surface scan for water
\begin{Snippet}
molecule h2o {
  O
  H 1 R
  H 1 R 2 A
}

Rvals=[0.9,1.0,1.1]
Avals=range(100,102,2)

table=Table(rows=["R","A"], cols=["E(SCF)","E(SCS)","E(DFMP2)"])

set basis cc-pvdz

for R in Rvals:
    h2o.R = R
    for A in Avals:
        h2o.A = A
        energy('dfmp2')
        escf = get_variable('SCF ENERGY')
        edfmp2 = get_variable('DF-MP2 ENERGY')
        escsmp2 = get_variable('SCS-DF-MP2 ENERGY')
        table[R][A] = [escf, escsmp2, edfmp2]

print table
relative=table.copy()
relative.absolute_to_relative()
print relative
\end{Snippet}
we first define a table (on line 10) with two row indices and three column
indices. As the potential energy scan is performed, the results are stored
(line 22) and the final table is printed to the output file (line 24). The
table is converted from absolute energies to relative energies (in kcal mol$^{-1}$)
on line 26, before being printed again. The relative energies are reported with
respect to the lowest value in each column. More examples of how to control the
formatting of the tables can be found in the sample input files provided; see
section \ref{test_suite} for a complete listing.
