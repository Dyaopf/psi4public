\section{Items to Disperse} \label{sec:disperse}

Place here interesting oddities that you think should be absorbed into the manual eventually.

\begin{itemize}
%\item If multiple molecules are specified in an input file, set a basis set below each since
%a set basis only attaches itself to the active (most recent) molecule.
\item Notate what gradient methods can only be run in $C_1$ symmetry.
%\item Environment variables accumulate over the course of a input file and are not cleared
%by clean(). So if you run a sto-3g FCI followed by a aug-cc-pVQZ SCF followed by a print\_variables()
%statement, the last will include both SCF TOTAL ENERGY and FCI TOTAL ENERGY. Don't get excited that
%you got a high-quality calculation cheaply.
\item All boolean options may be called through 1/0, yes/no, true/false, on/off, regardless of case.
\end{itemize}
