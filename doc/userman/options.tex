\section{Keywords Recognized by Each Module}\label{keywords}
This listing provides details of the keywords recognized by each module in the
code and, where appropriate, their allowed values.  Certain convergence and tolerance
threshold keywords, of type {\it double} (real numbers), may be specified using
either a real number or an integer; an integer $X$ is then treated as the
number of converged decimal digits required.  For example, to request an energy
converged to $10^{-6} E_h$, the user may set the {\tt e\_convergence} keyword
to 0.000001, 1.0e-6, or 6.
