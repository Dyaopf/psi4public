Documentation
=============

|PSIfour|'s documentation is generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
and lives in :source:`doc/sphinxman`. 

Installing Sphinx
-----------------

Installing Sphinx is only necessary to build the documentation 
yourself, locally. Ultimately, the docs will be served, either 
from trac or psicode, so most users/developers won't need Sphinx 
installed. Nevertheless, installation is easy.

On Mac::

    easy_install sphinx

On Linux:

* Download ::

    curl -O http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/S/Sphinx/Sphinx-1.1.3.tar.gz

* Unpack, etc.
* Build and Install ::

   python setup.py build
   sudo python setup.py install

Documentation Structure
-----------------------

Sphinx has nice capabilities for extracting docstrings from python files,
presenting both auto generated and explicitly composed documentation in
the same format, hyperlinking within and to trac/external websites, and
for generating documentation in different formats from the same source.
|PSIfour|'s documentation is a unified document covering information for
both users and programmers, with different portions served up depending on
the target audience. To this end, one can navigate to :source:`doc/sphinxman`
and build the following targets.::

    make html
    make latexpdf-user 
    make latexpdf-prog
