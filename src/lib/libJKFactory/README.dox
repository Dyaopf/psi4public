   The JK Builder Library is a collaborative effort to produce
   a library that is able to handle the creation of J and K Matrices
   in electronic strcutre theory, in a common, fast, and unified way. 
   The JK Builder library is designed to work fast and efficiently on both shared
   and distributed memory architectures and to be transparent to which architecture
   it is implemented on.
