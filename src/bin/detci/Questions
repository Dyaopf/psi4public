How can we do the PK algorithm choice better?
Why is the SCF converged to such crazy tolerences?
Where should we put a MP2 nat orb calc?
Read 4 index quantity from dpd without storing it in memory twice?

David's list

How do we free strings, graphs, SigmaData
Occs array is created twice if alplist != betlist

We seem to get the following a lot:
(sem_iter): H0block_->H0b_diag[1][0] - H0block_->H0b_diag[2][0] = -0.393516 - 0.393516 = -0.787032 > 1.0E-8
Is this a phase issue?
This is more of a warning, maybe its finding the wrong state.

Dump dpd library at the end
IncoreSOMCSCF that takes (aa|aa) (aa|aN)
