Make a pass through options:
    Prepend MCSCF

Wavefunction:
    DETCAS and DETCI wfn's. 
    Merge DETCAS into DETCI wavefunction.

DETCAS driver in detci main function:
    Only one init- only one string initialization
    Loop:
        Transform orbitals
        Optimize CI coefficients
        Optimize orbitals.

Merges:
    CalcInfo class:
        Identical Values:
            restricted_docc

        Two seperate integral buffers:
            One e bare/fzc
            Two e bare/fzc


All psi headers should be in "" not <>
