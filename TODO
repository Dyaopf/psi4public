Tasklist for PSI4: (X = fixed)

* Running psi4 without an input leads to an ugly crash in libpsio. Create a
more graceful exit. (TDC 12/17/2009)

* If cints --deriv1 is run without the "reference" keyword, it gives a
completely useless error message. (TDC 12/30/2009)

X Test case cc8 [UHF-CCSD(T)] fails in cscf.  Debug it. (TDC 12/17/2009)
